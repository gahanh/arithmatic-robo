# Arithmatic Robo Gym Environment. This environment can be used to train an RL Agent to learn ADD , SUBTRACT, MULTIPLY and DIVIDE actions.

The inputs are 2 randomly generated numbers. The Agent tries to find the best action to go from one number to another number.

To use this environment, download the repo zip file to your local drive. Unzip it, then upload the whole folder to your Google Drive.

Then open maths-rl.ipynb in Google Colab and step through.
